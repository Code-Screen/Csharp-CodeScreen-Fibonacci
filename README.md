# C#-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen `C#` assessment that requires the candidate to write a method that returns the n element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with fibonacci(0) returning 0 and fibonacci(1) returning 1.

The class to write this method in is [FibonacciCalculator.cs](src/FibonacciCalculator.cs).

The tests that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in [FibonacciCalculatorTest.cs](test/FibonacciCalculatorTest.cs).

The tests that are run and are not visible to the candidate are located in [FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.cs](test/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.cs).
